# FrozenMysteries
The Frozen Lake game is a classic example often used in reinforcement learning to illustrate the concepts of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and reinforcement learning algorithms. In this game, an agent (such as a person or a robot) navigates through a grid world, aiming to reach a goal while avoiding holes in a frozen lake.
